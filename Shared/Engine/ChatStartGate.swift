/// axis) remain separate surfaces. `ChatStartGate` folds BOTH axes plus
/// the active profile's default ONLY to decide what a *blocked send*
/// should tell the user and what action to offer next.
///
/// #397 — removes the state conflation. The prior gate fired off
/// `currentModelID() == nil` ALONE and always rendered the error-framed
/// "No model loaded / Load / Choose another", blind to whether the
/// engine was still starting, had failed, or the default was simply
/// not loaded yet. That made the common post-launch case ("engine not
/// up yet, default exists") read as a problem instead of the benign
/// "this profile's default (XYZ) isn't loaded yet — load it?".
///
/// Pure + value-only inputs so the whole matrix is unit-testable in the
/// fast `RatioThinkCoreTests` (SPM) tier without standing up an engine,
/// XPC, or SwiftUI.
